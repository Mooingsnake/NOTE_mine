#### p40 C 语言的起源

- **C was closely tied with the Unix operating system.** C was developed from the beginning as the
system programming language for Unix. Most of the Unix kernel (the core part of the operating
system), and all of its supporting tools and libraries, were written in C. As Unix became popular in
universities in the late 1970s and early 1980s, many people were exposed to C and found that they
liked it. Since Unix was written almost entirely in C, it could be easily ported to new machines,
which created an even wider audience for both C and Unix.

  c和unix操作系统紧密联系。 大多数的unix内核，以及他们的支持工具，库，都是用c写成的。
- **C is a small, simple language.** The design was controlled by a single person, rather than a committee,
and the result was a clean, consistent design with little baggage. The K&R book describes the
complete language and standard library, with numerous examples and exercises, in only 261 pages.
The simplicity of C made it relatively easy to learn and to port to different computers.

  c是一个很小，很简单的语言。设计者不是一个委员会而是一个人，所以它简单好用，K&R书就能描述完整个语言和标准库，甚至包含了大量的例子和联系，仅仅只有261页。

-  **C was designed for a practical purpose.** C was designed to implement the Unix operating system.
Later, other people found that they could write the programs they wanted, without the language
getting in the way

  c就是为了实现unix操作系统而诞生的，所以别的程序员想写程序的时候不会被语言问题绊倒

可以看到前三个 hello.c/hello.s/hello.i 都是text文本文件，后面两个是二进制文件，过程经历了源文件-》简单修改-》改成汇编-》转成二进制并链接-》变成可执行。
