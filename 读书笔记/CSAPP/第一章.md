- **C was closely tied with the Unix operating system.** C was developed from the beginning as the
system programming language for Unix. Most of the Unix kernel (the core part of the operating
system), and all of its supporting tools and libraries, were written in C. As Unix became popular in
universities in the late 1970s and early 1980s, many people were exposed to C and found that they
liked it. Since Unix was written almost entirely in C, it could be easily ported to new machines,
which created an even wider audience for both C and Unix.

  c和unix操作系统紧密联系。 大多数的unix内核，以及他们的支持工具，库，都是用c写成的。
- **C is a small, simple language.** The design was controlled by a single person, rather than a committee,
and the result was a clean, consistent design with little baggage. The K&R book describes the
complete language and standard library, with numerous examples and exercises, in only 261 pages.
The simplicity of C made it relatively easy to learn and to port to different computers.

  c是一个很小，很简单的语言。设计者不是一个委员会而是一个人，所以它简单好用，K&R书就能描述完整个语言和标准库，甚至包含了大量的例子和联系，仅仅只有261页。

-  **C was designed for a practical purpose.** C was designed to implement the Unix operating system.
Later, other people found that they could write the programs they wanted, without the language
getting in the way

  c就是为了实现unix操作系统而诞生的，所以别的程序员想写程序的时候不会被语言问题绊倒
  
  #### 1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms

可以看到前三个 hello.c/hello.s/hello.i 都是text文本文件，后面两个是二进制文件，过程经历了源文件-》简单修改-》改成汇编-》转成二进制并链接-》变成可执行。
- Preprocessing phase
  会处理这个“#include <stdio.h>”并形成一个.i为文件名后缀的文件
- Compilation phase
  从hello.i变成hello.s ，翻译成汇编语言

- Assembly phase
   下一步，从hello.s变成机器语言，同时打包成一个relocateable object的程序，并且储存结果在hello.o里面
  （Next, the assembler (as) translates hello.s into machinelanguage instructions, packages them in a form known as a relocatable object
program, and stores the result in the object file hello.o.）
- Linking phase.
  我们调用了printf，这是个c的标准库函数，存在在一个独立的预编译对象文件“printf.o”里，这个文件会合并到我们的hello.o程序里。linker主管合并，结果是hello文件便成了可执行文件，并且可以被加载进内存里，被操作系统执行。
  （. The printf function resides in a separate precompiled object file called printf.o, which
must somehow be merged with our hello.o program. The linker (ld) handles
this merging. The result is the hello file, which is an executable object file (or
simply executable) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by
the system.）

> GNU事什么
> 一个免税的组织，GNU project开发了一个除kernel以外的环境的主要组件，主要包括：emacs editor, gcc compiler, gdb debugger,
assembler, linker, utilities for manipulating binaries, and other components。GCC编译器已经逐渐支持多个语言，比如e C, C++, Fortran, Java, Pascal, Objective-C, and Ada。另外GNU的理念事免费！
